# Contributing to AI-Assisted Component Development Workflow

Thank you for considering contributing to this project!

## How to Contribute

### 1. Share Your Experience
- Open an issue describing a failure mode we haven't covered
- Share success stories of using this workflow
- Suggest improvements based on your projects

### 2. Framework-Specific Guides
If you've adapted this workflow for a specific framework (React, Vue, Flutter, etc.), we'd love to include it as a supplementary guide.

### 3. Template Improvements
Found a section that should be in a template? Or one that should be removed? Let us know!

### 4. Documentation Clarity
If something in the master workflow is unclear, that's a bug. Help us fix it.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Be specific:** "This section was confusing" is less helpful than "Section 3.2 doesn't explain when to use API contracts"
- **Include context:** What were you building? What went wrong? How did you fix it?
- **Respect the philosophy:** This workflow emphasizes minimal documentation and human validation
- **No over-engineering:** If a suggestion adds complexity without clear value, we'll discuss alternatives

## Code of Conduct

- Be constructive
- Assume good intent
- Focus on improving the workflow for solo/small team developers

## Questions?

Open an issue with the "question" label. We're happy to discuss workflow applications.
