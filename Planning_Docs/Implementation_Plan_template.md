## Build Order Overview

```
Order 1: Foundation → Order 2: Core Logic → Order 3: Integration → Order 4: Polish
```

---

## Build Order 1: Foundation Components
**Dependencies:** None (can be built in parallel)

### [Component Name]
**Purpose:** [What it does]  
**Functions:** [List key functions]  
**Files:** [filename.py (~estimated lines)]  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Used By:** [Which components need this?]

### [Component Name]
**Purpose:** [What it does]  
**Functions:** [List key functions]  
**Files:** [filename.py (~estimated lines)]  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Used By:** [Which components need this?]

---

## Integration Checkpoint 1
**Test Before Proceeding:**
- [ ] All Build Order 1 components independently validated
- [ ] No files exceed 300 lines
- [ ] All functions documented in Function Registry

---

## Build Order 2: [Layer Name]
**Dependencies:** Build Order 1 complete

### [Component Name]
**Purpose:** [What it does]  
**Functions:** [List key functions]  
**Files:** [filename.py (~estimated lines)]  
**Dependencies:** [List from Build Order 1]  
**Used By:** [Which components need this?]

---

## Integration Checkpoint 2
**Test Before Proceeding:**
- [ ] Build Order 2 components validated independently
- [ ] Integration between Order 1 ↔ Order 2 tested
- [ ] Data flows correctly between layers
- [ ] No unexpected function duplication

---

## Build Order 3: [Next Layer]
**Dependencies:** Build Order 2 complete

[Continue pattern...]

## Risk Identification

### Component: [Name]
**Risk:** [What could go wrong?]  
**Mitigation:** [How to prevent it?]

---

## Integration Strategy

### [Component A] → [Component B]
**Data Flow:** [What data moves between them?]  
**Test Criteria:** [How do you verify it works?]
